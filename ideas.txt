generating distributions
------------------------
    + there are probably canned routines for this but it would be 
      interesting to do our own
    + mma had interesting stuff about conditional probabilities..
      There are actually TONS of interesting examples in mma docs.
      It would be interesting to actually work through some of these.
    + calculating moments of distributions
    + study interesting distributions
        - Poisson?
        - others?`

random matrices
---------------

central limit theorem
---------------------
    + sample non-gaussian distribution
    + plot distribution of average
    + how large does n have to be to satisfy clt?
        - comparing two distributions, checking for gaussianity
        - relation to t-distributions?
    + connection with renormalization group

resampling methods
------------------
    + jackknife
    + bootstrap

bayesian vs. frequentist methods
--------------------------------
    + how does fitting differ?
    + how do priors work?

simple fitting
--------------
    + what if errors are not gaussian?
    + parameter estimation

fat-tailed distributions
-----------------------
